# curves_panel
 Color curves graph component similar to the color curve components found in Photoshop, PaintShop Pro and other graphic image editors.  The basic purpose of a curves component is to map values from the x-axis (input) of the graph to the y-axis (output).  By adjusting the shape of the curve, you remap values from the x-axis to different values on the y-axis.
 
 This component is based on the javax.swing.JPanel, and can easily be added to and JFrame or JDialog.
 
 You can also specify an image to use as the component's background.  In the screenshots below, I used an image of a histogram as background.

 An example of how I used it.  Screenshot3 shows the CurvesPanel component along with other components as part of a graphics editor app.
