# curves_panel
 Color curves graph component similar to the color curve components found in Photoshop, PaintShop Pro and other graphic image editors.
 
 This component is based on the javax.swing.JPanel, and can easily be added to and JFrame or JDialog.
 
 You can also specify an image to use as the component's background.  In the screenshots below, I used an image of a histogram as background.
